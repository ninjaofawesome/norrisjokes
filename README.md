# NORRIS JOKES:  All Chuck Norris Jokes, All The Time

## WHAT IS THIS?

Norrisjokes is a project that I put together primarily to learn:
* How to use an API with React.
* More about with state management and API's(using Redux).
* More about routing with React.

Currently, this project is a work in progress.  The readme will be updated as to what features Norrisjokes has to offer at a later date.

This project was built using the [Facebook Create React App generator](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), unejected.
